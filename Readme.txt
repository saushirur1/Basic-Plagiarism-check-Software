Basic-Plagiarism-check-Software

--> A Basic Plagiarism check software which determines the similarity between two documents,
A higher percentage means both the documents are similar, while a lesser percentage says that
the two documents differ.
--> A word check is computed using dot product, and the angle between the two vectors is
computed to determine the similarity percentage.

User manual:
--> Run all the files on terminal using the command
g++ check.h check.cpp checkmain.cpp
--> enter the names of the files you want to compare or check for Plagiarism
--> A result of 0(in degrees) means that the two files are really similar, a
result of 90(in degrees ) will imply that that two documents differ and have no
similarity
